## Defeating narcissism and creating community

Maybe we should use a Facebook-like mutual follow agreement for connections. And then anyone can follow a group. But this does produce friction, which may be good or bad. Good because it makes you think more about who you connect with. Bad for people that want others to see their information. But they could create a group for easily sharing information. 

We could limit how many connections. 150 like Path or YouVersion. If we left following open-ended, this would help curve the follow-me-I'll-follow-you-back technique. Groups could be not included in that number to make it feel less restrictive.

If we use open-ended following, we could limit to 300-500 people you can follow. It's enough to not feel entirely limiting, but not too much to create overload or give place to trolls. It doesn't have to be emphasized like how Path did or YouVersion does. When you reach your following limit, it can suggest people to unfollow based on how little you have interacted with them. 

    When you limit the number of connections a user is allowed to make, it can lead to them make no connections at all.

    Responding to a friend request on Facebook doesn't require much thought. There's no real consequence if you accept an invitation. But on Path, you have to constantly weigh if a person is close enough to you to take one of your coveted 150 slots. If the answer is no, you reject them. You certainly don't reach out to them with a friend request. â€”http://www.businessinsider.com/paths-problem-too-few-friends-2013-10

What if you could only join communities instead of making individual connections? But once inside a group, it is like your regular social networks (at least in the Faithlife groups it is). Plus communities are way more confusing than social media. 

Add some community features, even if it is a social network. Like community highlights/topical Bible.

We could hide numbers of followers. Maybe show the users how many people are following them, but not show the same to others. Some may argue that they don't think someone is very good if they have less than 100 followers. But what if that person has really good things to say but hasn't been discovered yet? And many followers does not necessarily equal quality content. Many a teenager on Instagram had thousands of followers with only one blurry photo posted. And how many people follow just for trolling purposes?

Other things in life don't show public numbers, but we still use them. A blog does not have a counter that states how many people subscribe to the RSS feed. If the content is high in quality and meaningful it will be linked to, shared, and show up high in search results.

### Groups instead of individual followers/following

* You can either follow a group or join it
* Each user gets a private, personal group
* A group can be 1. open (anyone can join) 2. closed (only join by invitation from someone in the group) or 3. approval only (any user can ask to join a group, but someone inside must accept them).

## Fostering depth

People spend hours on Facebook, but don't really spend time on the things they see. 

Limit how much people see at one time. Use algorithms to show what is relevant in the margin. Too much causes people to just skim through it. 

Add a way for editors to pin quality content in the margin even if the person does not follow the content creator. Sort of like the featured page on the App Store, but for each Bible chapter.
