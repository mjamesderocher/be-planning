Nehemiah 6

Don't focus on the enemies, but on our response to them.


## Don't get distracted from your goal. V. 1-4

Know God's will for your life.

    Ephesians 5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

Learn to say no.

One person can't do everything. He shouldn't try.

We are part of the body of Christ. Can one part of the body do everything?

Find out what thing God wants you to do in the church and do it faithfully with all your heart. Vacuuming the church, playing an instrument, teaching Sunday School.

It's the little detours that keep you from completing your goals.

Sanballet wanted Nehemiah to have a peace talk. This does not seem like a bad thing, but it was still a distraction.

Jesus said even the cares of life can distract you.

    Luke 8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

Draft a personal mission statement. 

My personal mission statement is based off the Great Comissionâ€”to go into all the world and teach people and make disciples of them. 

## Don't be distracted by people's opinions. V. 5-9

Do what God told you to do, even if others disagree.

There will always be someone that will say something.

Don't spend a ton of time chasing down the rumors or trying to defend what you are doing.

You can't please everyone.

(Story about donkey, boy, and old man)

A pastor that is always swayed by the congregation is not leading them, but being lead by them. A person should be glad if their pastor doesn't always do everything asked of him.

## Don't hide from problems. V. 10-14

Some people never do anything because they are paralyzed in fear of what people would say. 

Luke 19:11-27
