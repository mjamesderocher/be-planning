## Take time for the Word v. 1-4

The building project was completed, but that is not the end of the story.

They had a time of digging into the Word.

Diligent Christian service cannot take the place of listening to the voice of God.

Martha worked; Mary listened.

## Respect the Word v. 5-6

Some churches stand when reading the Bible, that's fine, but standing doesn't really mean you respect it. 

The Bible is not just another book, and we should treat it differently.

>Psalms 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed,
when I have respect unto all thy commandments.

## Understand the Word v. 7-8

Often when we speak of the book of Nehemiah, we talk of the walls being standards. But we never talk about how those standards are found.

>John 5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

Let's not lie to ourselves, the Bible is a difficult book to understand. 

We have many different conflicting opinions because people don't take time to really understand the Bible. 

## Rejoice at the Word v. 9-12

Our response to God's Word should be one of joy.

Too often people get made at the Word and go somewhere else.

## Respond to the Word v. 13-18

Too often, our response to the Word is emotional only.

>James 1:22-25 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
