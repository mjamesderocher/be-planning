#version 1.0 features

Following are a list of tasks that we want a user to be able to preform when we launch our first new iteration. We will test these features extensively to ensure  that everything works, looks good, is usable, and is accessible. We will then make iOS and Android apps with the same features. Other features may be developed, but should not be put into production until these things are fully functional and tested.
