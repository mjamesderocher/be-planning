    I miss the simple app this once was by EelBait
    This app once was a great app in that it had a simple goal which it achieved â€“ a simple Bible reader. Lately, the developers have been more concerned with adding a lot of social bling that not only detracts from the intent of the app, but actively prevents it. There is no way to disable the noise, so I'm dropping this app from my devi ces.
    
    Love the bible not this app. by Jdlazojr
here's too much going on with this app, it's crowded. Every time I open the verse for the day it takes me out of my spot in the bible for my regular reading. I tried bookmarking my spot but it takes effort for that, you have to unbookmark the old spot then bookmark the new spot. It's not that easy and doing that every time is not necessary.
