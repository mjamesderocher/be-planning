 Psa 113:5  Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!

## Who is as powerful as God?

### He knows everything (omniscient)

We make a big deal of scientists and inventors, but what they have done, it is largely because of what others before them have done or written.

### He is always there (omnipresent)

Psalms 139:7-10   
Whither shall I go from thy spirit?   
or whither shall I flee from thy presence?   
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:   
if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.   
If I take the wings of the morning,   
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;   
Even there shall thy hand lead me,   
and thy right hand shall hold me.   

### He can do anything (omnipotent)

## Who is as loving as God?

### He loves His creation

He wants no one to die in sins. 

John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

Jeremiah 31:3 The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

1. I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,   
Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.   
I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,   
That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.   
2. I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine   
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,   
That he should extend his great love unto such as I,   
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.   
3. I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!   
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?   
No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,   
Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.   
(Chorus)   
Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me   
Enough to die for me!   
Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

### He cares for the needs of man

Matthew 7:7-11 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

Matthew 6:24-34 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

God knows what you need and He will supply exactly what it is you need. 

He will supply your need, not your greed.

Not everything we think we need, we actually need.

## Who is as merciful as God?

There is a reason we call it amazing grace.

God forgives people that we would never forgive. 

Psalms 117 O praise the Lord, all ye nations:
praise him, all ye people.
For his merciful kindness is great toward us:
and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.
Praise ye the Lord.
