## We Are Protected in His Shadow

>Psalms 27:1
>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

There are many blessings that come from being under the shadow of God.

We no longer need to fight the battles ourselves.

The Israelites were worried about getting around the Red Sea, but they were told to stand still and see the salvation of God.

When David faced the giant, he knew that God would have the victory.

## We Are Close to God in His Shadow

We gain protection under God's shadow, but we also have to give up doing things our way.

If you are going to be in someone's shadow, you have to be close to them. You can't wander off wherever you want. You have to **follow**.

Someone cannot follow two different people at the same time.

You can't have it your way and **also** have it God's way.

The monkey trap: you can't have true freedom while you hold on to things.

God knows better than we do what is best for us.

>**Ephesians 3:20**
>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

There is a saying attributed to Henry Ford that goes, "If I would have asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Though it doesn't seem that he actually said it.

The things we want aren't always what is best for us. The story of King Midas helps us understand this.

Israel thought what they needed was a king, but God knew that there was a better way.

>"Always remember that the will of God is your safety." ---AW Tozer

>"The soul is never in a better frame, than when it puts itself as a blank in Jesus' hand, to stamp on it what he pleases." ---George Whitefield

## We Are hidden in His Shadow

If you are in someone's shadow, then you are hidden.

If we want the blessings of God, then we must be willing to give up our identity.

>**John 3:30** 
He must increase, but I must decrease.

>**Ezra 5:11** 
And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.

Paul was identified as the servant (slave) of Jesus Christ.

Many people in the Bible are referred to as "a prophet of God" without giving their actual name.

Our identity is in Christ. We are hidden in him.

>**Colossians 3:3** 
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

When people see our good works, they should give glory to God.

>**Matthew 5:16** 
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

People don't need to know **who we are**, but they need to know who God is.

We are bombarded mantras such as "Be you!" and "Express yourself!" that promote us as someone special and important. We need to promote God, and not ourselves.

Children's songs sing "I am special, I am special, look at me" to the tune of Feres Jacques.

We are told that we can be whatever we want to be, but really we can only be what God wants us to be.
